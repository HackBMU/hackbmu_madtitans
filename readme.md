## 1.   Introduction
The application aims to bridge the gap between NGOs and less-fortunate people of all around the streets of the country. Users can create a public record of the homeless people, Women, Child under labors and all sorts of Vagrants found on the streets of the country with the Geographical location tag. NGOs/Authorities can access these records on the Website or on Application and contact the needy people. They can then try to help them by analyzing their needs. The NGOs/Authorities will also have the options to select a status for a particular entry, for example: “contacting”, “helping” etc. This whole process is listed on the website for public to see thus, maintaining the transparency throughout the process.

This Android application is built on .NET and Xamarin Framework , and hence, can also be ported across Major platforms, like iOS and Windows.

# 4.    Running The Project
Let  us remind you again that the minimum Android OS that you need to run this project is Lollipop (API Level 21). So, make sure you're satisfying the minimum requirements first. Otherwise, your handset won't be able to parse the apk file.

- ### Permissions Required :
    This application requires you to provide few permissions to it, in order to work properly. Here's the list of permissions that the application needs :
    - Internet Access
    - View WiFi Connections
    - Storage (Read/Write Perms For Cache)
    - Camera (For Taking Pictures)

- #### Instructions For Direct APK Installation :
    If you want to run this application on your android phone, please move over to the "[`Downloads`](https://github.com/HackBMU/hackbmu_madtitans)" section and download the latest stable APK build for your android phone. You do not need any external libraries or application.

- #### Instructions For Developers/Testers :
     If you're a developer or any user who wishes to test this application and run this android project, it's recommended to install Visual Studio with Xamarin Support and Android SDKs on your system. Remember that Android SDKs should be in your local path for you to be able to compile the project properly. You can find the source code in the "[SOURCE](https://bitbucket.org/madtitans/helping-hands/src)" directory.

    If you do not happen to have Visual Studio, it is recommended to get it because it'll download all the required packages on its own, if they're not present. You can use Visual Studio's Free Community Edition. It'll work, as we've developed this application on it.

But, if for some reason, you don't want to or can't install Visual Studio, you will need to have .NET, Xamarin, Android SDK and required Packages in your system's local path for you to be able to compile and execute this application project.
